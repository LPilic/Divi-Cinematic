# Divi Cinematic Email Template

This is an email template for the [Newsletter][4] plugin. It has a number of built-in options and supports automatically generating a summary of the coming soon listings.

## How to use

The email files are kept in the theme folder so we can keep them up-to-date with the theme, but to get the email template to actually show up in Newsletter, you'll need to copy or move the `divi-cinematic` folder out of this directory and into `/wp-content/extensions/Newsletter/emails/themes/`

## Options
- Header image URL
- Background colour
- Accent colour
- Accent text colour
- Movie Summary Toggle (show a summary of the coming soon listings, or leave it blank for an email with your own content)
- Coming Soon URL (for building links that take the viewer directly to that listing on the website)
- Website and Facebook Link URLs (plus the option to hide them altogether)
- Footer name and address (company information is required by law in mailing lists)
