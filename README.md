# Divi Cinematic
A WordPress child theme based on [Divi][1]. Commissioned for a local Canadian theatre. It has a robust movie listing post type that automatically retrieves movie details, poster, etc.

Features:
- Automatic movie detail propagation in Movie editor
  - Enter the movie title, click **Fetch Movie Details** and that's it
    - Runtime, cast, synopsis, YouTube trailer and official website are all fetched
    - Genres are automatically assigned, or created if necessary, in the Genres taxonomy
    - The movie poster is automatically assigned as the Featured Image
- Automatic updates from this GitHub repository
	- Using the native WordPress update system
- Interactive tutorials using [Intro.js][2]
	- “How to Create a Movie Listing”
	- “How to Edit a Cloned Movie”
	- “How to Clone a Movie”<sup>1</sup>
	- “How to Send a Newsletter”<sup>2</sup>

This theme contains copyrights and credits to the business overseeing its design. It is not intended for public use. You are, however, free to fork this repository and edit it to your heart's content. Credit back to this repository is greatly appreciated.

If there is demand for it, I might be pursuaded to release the movie post type as a standalone plugin.
